# Kolhapur
*Because you must look before you leave!*

The issue of safety is of crucial importance in Kolhapur with escalating crime rates. Utilizing crime-related data effectively,
we've developed an app that suggests alternative routes between any two places in Kolhapur, providing information not only about time duration and distance but 
also a 'Danger Index' for each route.

## Technical Complexity:

We applied an Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm to determine the danger index of multiple routes between two places.

We utilized a Clustering algorithm: K-Means, to rate criminal activities in 157 places on the map of Kolhapur on a scale of 0 to 4. K-means clustering is employed in
unsupervised machine learning for unlabeled data, aiming to find groups in the data with the number of groups represented by the variable K. The algorithm assigns each 
data point to one of K clusters iteratively based on feature similarity. The results include centroids of K clusters and labels for the training data.

To preprocess the data for machine learning, we scaled the values using the following formula:

\[
\text{Scaled Values} = \left(\text{Sum Values} - \text{Min Value}\right) \times \frac{\text{New Max} - \text{New Min}}{\text{Max Value} - \text{Min Value}} + \text{New Min}
\]

This formula transforms the original values (Sum Values) from their current range (Min Value to Max Value) to a new range (New Min to New Max). This scaling is crucial
for preparing data for machine learning algorithms.

The 'Danger Index' for a given path is calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{Danger Index} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{Magnitude}_i}{\text{Count of Occurrences}}
\]

Here's a simplified explanation of the components:
1. Magnitude: This represents the severity of each crime occurrence along the path. It’s summed up for all occurrences (from 1 to N).
2. Count of occurrences: This is the total number of crime occurrences along the path.
3. Danger Index: This is calculated by dividing the sum of the magnitudes by the count of occurrences. It gives an average measure of the ‘danger’ for
   the path based on the crime data.

## APIs - Google Maps JavaScript API:

We employed Google Maps and Google Places APIs to display all possible routes between any two locations, along with their associated danger index. An autocomplete feature in
the search bars enables users to select starting and destination locations, along with the mode of travel (e.g., walking, driving, or transit). This displays routes with 
markers indicating the danger level of places along those routes. The displayed data below the map includes relevant information such as time durations, distances, and danger 
indexes of all possible routes between the entered places, enabling users to make informed decisions while selecting a route.

## Result of Training the Model:

The K-means algorithm assigns values from 0 to 4 to 157 locations in Kolhapur. An index of 0 indicates relatively low crime rates in the past, while an index of 4
indicates high crime records. Various legends are used to display the safety index of different locations in Kolhapur:

### Legend:
- Green Ticks: Safest
- Smiley: Moderately Safe
- Exclamation Mark: Be Careful
- Skull: Moderately Dangerous
- Cross: Extremely Dangerous

This comprehensive approach provides users with valuable insights into the safety levels of various routes in Kolhapur, empowering them to make safer travel choices.
