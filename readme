# Kolhapur Safety Route Suggestion App

This project addresses the crucial issue of safety in Kolhapur, where escalating crime rates are a significant concern. Our app suggests alternative routes between any two places in Kolhapur, providing information on time duration, distance, and a 'Danger Index' for each route.

## Technical Overview

### Unsupervised Machine Learning

We implemented an Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm to determine the Danger Index of multiple routes. The K-Means Clustering algorithm is employed to rate criminal activities in 157 places on the map of Kolhapur, on a scale of 0 to 4. 

- **K-Means Clustering**: 
  - Groups data points based on feature similarity.
  - Iteratively assigns each data point to one of K clusters.
  - The outcome includes centroids of K clusters and labels for the training data.

### Data Preprocessing

To prepare the data for machine learning, we scaled the values using the following formula:

```text
Scaled Values = (Sum Values - Min Value) √ó (New Max - New Min) / (Max Value - Min Value) + New Min
```

This formula transforms the original values into a new range, making them suitable for the machine learning algorithm.

### Danger Index Calculation

The 'Danger Index' for a given path is calculated as follows:

```text
Danger Index = Sum of Magnitudes / Count of Occurrences
```

Where:
- **Magnitude**: Severity of each crime occurrence along the path.
- **Count of Occurrences**: Total number of crime occurrences along the path.

This calculation provides an average measure of the 'danger' for a path based on crime data.

## APIs - Google Maps JavaScript API

We utilized the Google Maps and Google Places APIs to display possible routes between two locations, along with their associated Danger Index. Features include:

- **Autocomplete Search Bars**: Users can select starting and destination locations, and choose the mode of travel (walking, driving, or transit).
- **Route Information**: Displays time duration, distance, and Danger Index for each route.
- **Markers**: Indicates the danger level of places along the routes.

## Model Training Results

The K-Means algorithm assigns values from 0 to 4 to 157 locations in Kolhapur:

- **0**: Low crime rate (Safest)
- **4**: High crime rate (Most Dangerous)

### Legend

- üü¢ **Green Tick**: Safest
- üôÇ **Smiley**: Moderately Safe
- ‚ùó **Exclamation Mark**: Be Careful
- ‚ò†Ô∏è **Skull**: Moderately Dangerous
- ‚ùå **Cross**: Extremely Dangerous

## Conclusion

This app provides users with valuable insights into the safety levels of various routes in Kolhapur, empowering them to make safer travel choices.
